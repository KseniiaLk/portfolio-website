Our development stack consisted of React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Figma. We aimed to design an intuitive user interface with a strong focus on usability and data visualisation that helped streamline the team's workflow and reduce their manual workload. We were committed to producing high-quality code, so I was responsible for writing efficient and scalable code, as well as conducting PR reviews on my colleagues' code."
